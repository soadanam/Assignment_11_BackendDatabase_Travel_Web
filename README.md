# Tourism Website - "Travelian"

## Website address: 
www.travelian.com

###

1. As the creator of this website, I have designed a home page with a header that contains links to various sections of the website, such as Home, About, Services, Contact, and more. The banner section is a large and visually appealing image or video that showcases my brand and the products/services that I offer.

2. In the Offerings section, I have included at least six main items or services that users can purchase. Each item is displayed with a relevant name, image, short description, and a purchase button that leads to the Place Order page. I have organized the items/services in rows based on my design.

3. To help users understand how my service works, I have included a How It Works section that explains the process of placing an order and the delivery process. In addition, I have included a Testimonials section that displays reviews and feedback from satisfied customers along with their names and photos.

4. To ensure the security of the website, I have implemented a private/protected route that requires authentication. Users can log in using their Google, Facebook, Github, or email/password credentials. Once logged in, their name and profile picture will appear in the header, along with a Logout button.

5. On the My Orders page, logged-in users can view their orders and cancel/delete any order they want. I have also added a confirmation dialog to ensure that users don't accidentally delete an order.

6. Finally, all data will be stored in a NoSQL database such as MongoDB Atlas to ensure data security and scalability



# FOR BONUS 

1. I've added a Manage All Orders page where the admin can view and delete all orders placed by users. A confirmation message will appear before deletion.
2. An Add A New Service page has been added for the admin to add new services that will appear on the home page. An image URL can be inputted for each service.
3. Each order placed will have a default status of "pending" and the admin can update the status to "approved" on the Manage All Orders page with a simple button.
4. The website has a meaningful name and consistent look and feel with relevant content and images.
5. The code is clean and organized with components and comments when needed.
6. A loading spinner has been added to the home page when data is loading.
8. The website is responsive and optimized for desktop and mobile devices. Tablet responsiveness is optional.
9. The website uses a .env file to hide database user and password information and a .gitignore file to prevent sensitive information from being pushed to the repository.
10. A meaningful readme.md file has been added that contains the website name, a little description, a link to the live site, and at least five bullet points highlighting the different features and functionalities of the website.
